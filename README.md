# CN_Commodity_Demand_Forecasting

Description of the challenge

The challenge involves devising and implementing a Machine Learning (ML) model to predict the demand for one or more commodities over forecast horizons of 3, 6, and 12 months.  Participants will utilize the last 20 years of historical market data available to inform their predictions. The specific commodities targeted for prediction include lumber & wood products, as well as intermodal containers and trailers.  The project emphasizes the importance of improving demand forecasting to enable CN to optimize its planning and operations effectively.  By proactively capturing more market share, the participants will demonstrate how an ML-powered solution can support informed business decision-making.  Additionally, participants are expected to engage with business domain knowledge and provide guidance on relevant data sources to ensure the model's effectiveness and applicability in a real-world context.  The challenge invites innovative approaches and ethical considerations in the development of AI-driven forecasting tools

What you will accomplish

The goal of this challenge is to develop an effective Machine Learning model that can accurately predict the demand for selected commodities over various forecast horizons (3, 6, and 12 months). By leveraging historical market data, participants will explore ethical considerations surrounding AI development and its impact on business decision-making. Ultimately, the challenge aims to enhance demand forecasting capabilities to improve operational planning and increase market competitiveness for CN.

Criteria for judgement

We will score your submissions based on SMAPE score. The score on the leaderboard is the harmonic mean between the SMAPE score and the other metrics if applicable.
